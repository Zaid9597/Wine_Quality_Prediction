# Wine_Quality_Prediction
Using the wine quality dataset from kaggle, I have tried to answer the following questions:
1. Can I predict the quality of wine?
2. Is the wine good or bad?

The answer to the first question is that we can surely predict the quality of wine using linear regression and we could also classify if the wine is good or bad using the classification algorithms. Here in this project, I have used the logistic regression and Random Forest Classifier algorithms to classify the good and bad wine. Furthermore, I have compared the mentioned classification algorithms and concluded that the Random Forest Classifier Algorithm works well with the wine quality dataset and gives more accurate predictions.
